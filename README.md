# Data Analysis Projects in Python
Hi! This is a repository of my mini-data projects to practice my Python skills.

## NYC Regents Exploratory Analysis
I did some exploratory analysis about the 2015 to 2019 Regents state test results in NYC to identify trends across multiple variables, such as disability status, ethnicity,
English language learning status, and gender.

I added notes to clarify how to interpret the college readiness measurements in the dataset.

9/29/22
I uploaded another draft.

9/22/22
I did some proofreading and made some corrections, mostly regarding calculations, syntax, spelling, and grammar. I deleted the first draft and uploaded the 
edited draft.

9/21/22
I uploaded the first draft of the analysis in Jupyter Notebook.

## NYC Motor Collisions Analysis
I visualized the collision frequency of vehicles across zip codes, time of day, and time of year. I also created a random forest model to predict the number of 
casualities based on multiple factors, but it turned out it was not a suitable model for this context. Simple statistics, such as mode or average, was better for this 
problem.

I uploaded the analysis in Jupyter Notebook.
