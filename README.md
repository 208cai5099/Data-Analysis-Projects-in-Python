# NYC-Regents-Exploratory-Analysis
I did some exploratory analysis about the 2015 to 2019 Regents state test results in NYC. I hope I did a decent job at interpreting the data. 

Just to be clear, any opinion or statement in this analysis is my own and does not reflect the opinion of the NYC Department of Education, schools in NYC, and 
my previous employers.

I uploaded the first draft of the analysis in Jupyter Notebook.

I did some proofreading and made some corrections, mostly regarding calculations, syntax, and grammar. I deleted the first draft and reuploaded the edited draft.
