# Data Analysis Prokects in Python
Hi! This is a repository of my mini-data projects to practice my Python skills.
Any opinion or statement in these analyses is my own and does not reflect the opinion of any other entity.


## NYC Regents Exploratory Analysis
I did some exploratory analysis about the 2015 to 2019 Regents state test results in NYC to identify trends across multiple variables, such as disability status, ethnicity,
English language learning status, and gender.

I uploaded the first draft of the analysis in Jupyter Notebook.

I did some proofreading and made some corrections, mostly regarding calculations, syntax, spelling, and grammar. I deleted the first draft and uploaded the 
edited draft.

## NYC Motor Collisions Analysis
I visualized the collision frequency of vehicles across zip codes, time of day, and time of year. I also created a random forest model to predict the number of 
casualities based on multiple factors, but the accuracy is low.
